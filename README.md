# Uplift Modeling README

## Introduction
This repository contains code and analysis for uplift modeling using Python. Uplift modeling, also known as incremental modeling or net modeling, aims to predict the incremental response of an individual to a treatment or intervention.

## Contents
1. **Library Imports**: Importing necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Helper Functions**: Custom functions for data preprocessing, resampling, and computing uplift metrics.
3. **Data Preparation**: Steps to prepare the data for uplift modeling, including train-test split, random undersampling, target class encoding, and feature scaling.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure and distribution of target variables.
5. **Resampling**: Addressing class imbalance through resampling techniques such as random undersampling.
6. **Uplift Model Estimators Initialization and Prediction**: Initializing and fitting various uplift model estimators, including Solo Model (SM), Two Models (TM), and Uplift LGWUM (Lift Generalized Weighted Uplift Modeling).
7. **Model Evaluation and Visualization**: Computing uplift scores and visualizing cumulative gain vs. proportion of users targeted for different uplift models.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and implications of the uplift modeling analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
